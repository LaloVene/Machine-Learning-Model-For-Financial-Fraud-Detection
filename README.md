# Machine-Learning-Model-For-Financial-Fraud-Detection
For this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the outcome in a given dataset. I will be using a dataset from kaggle that is composed of 6 million of money transactions. Here the goal is to predict if a given transaction is fraudelent or not.
